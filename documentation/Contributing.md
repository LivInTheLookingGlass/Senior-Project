#Contributing
-----------------

Contributions are currently closed. They will be opened in the future, but for now this must be an independent, or mostly independent, project.  This is partly a personal stipulation, and partly to make submitting this as my senior research project easier.

##When they are open...

Contributions will go as follows

1. Make a fork
2. Make your changes
3. Submit a pull request
4. Code goes through checks
  1. Working code
  2. Naming conventions
  3. Doc strings
  4. Security impact
5. Pull request is merged

You can also make an issue, and it may get tackled that way.

###Naming standard

These are tentative and subject to change

* Temporary variables: keep to one word (ie, manager, string, etc)
* Constant variables:  all_lowercase_with_underscores
* All others:          camelCase
