<h1>
<a id="senior-project" class="anchor" href="#senior-project" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Senior Project</h1>

<h2>
<a id="abstract" class="anchor" href="#abstract" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Abstract</h2>

<p>A generalized, peer-to-peer platform for programs like Folding at Home, which rewards users with micropayments for solving NP problems.</p>

<h2>
<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>With the rise of distributed computing projects, from <a href="https://folding.stanford.edu/">Folding at Home</a>, <a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">SETI</a>, etc., there is a distinct lack of standardization in their distribution methods. Because of this, anyone who wants to tap into this trove of information must design their own platform and market this to the world. It’s not surprising that it’s been slow to diversify.</p>

<p>Another problem is that clients have no incentive to run these programs, save for charitable inclinations. Until recently, it would have been next to impossible to provide an incentive. However, with the onset of cryptocurrencies, there is now an easy solution. If people are provided a reward for problems, they can gain a passive income for their idle resources. This becomes their incentive.<script type="text/javascript">addFootnote("Users will have the option of running this for free. The bounty is to encourage participation, and is not strictly necessary.");</script></p>

<h2>
<a id="design" class="anchor" href="#design" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Design Goals</h2>
<p>There are four attacks that I currently anticipate on this platform. Each of them must be addressed in its design, and throughout this proposal I will point out when they are.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Mallicious user
		<ul>
			<li>This is a Denial of Service attack on the servers. By spoofing an active user (not solving the problems it is sent), an attacker could waste the money and processing time of the server.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Mallicious server
		<ul>
			<li>This is a Denial of Service attack on the user and charity servers (one which does not pay). By spoofing a charity server, an attacker could send useless programs, which, for instance, add random sums forever. Such an attack would go against the wishes of the user (not contributing towards general research), and force real charity servers to provide payment which they may not be able to afford.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Dishonest server
		<ul>
			<li>This is a Denial of Service attack on the user and platform. By broadcasting a bounty with a substantial reward, an attacker could trick nodes into wasting their computational time. This would drive up the general price of the platform, and possibly force it to a halt.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Outside actors
		<ul>
			<li>It is very possible that an outside bad actor could misuse the platform. One such misuse could be hiring out a botnet.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a id="security" class="anchor" href="#security" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Security</h2>

<p>Because a client is allowing other people to run unknown code on their computer, there needs to be a way to keep things secure. This is possible by the use of a sandbox, making Java an ideal language for this platform. While this is less efficient than other languages, it builds a security solution into the network and client itself.</p>

<p>There will also be cases where one will want to run it in a bigger sandbox. Support for this type of operation is critical for companies like Intel, AMD, NVidia, and Samsung, which may want to test edge cases of their products in the wild. If everything is completely sandboxed, there’s no way for them to easily guarantee that they are getting to the correct devices. These use cases will be investigated, as they could make up most of the demand for this network. If they are feasible, a permissioning system will be used to select different security policies for each program</p>

<h2>
<a id="bounties" class="anchor" href="#bounties" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bounties</h2>

<p>A bounty is the mechanism by which one notifies the network of a new problem to solve. It is sent as an object with all the data a user needs to verify, prioritize, connect to the sending server, and select the proper security policy.</p>

<pre class="line-numbers  language-python">
  <code class=" language-python">
    """An object representation of a Bounty
    Parts:
    ip       -- The ip address of the requesting node
    btc      -- The Bitcoin address of the requesting party
    reward   -- The reward amount in satoshis to be given over 24 hours (x | x == 0 or 1440 <= x <= 100000000) (1440 is 1 satoshi/minute)
    ident    -- A value set by the issuer to determine which problem/test to send
    timeout  -- Unix time at which the bounty expires (defaults to 24 hours)
    data     -- A dictionary containing optional, additional information
      author -- String which represents the group providing the Bounty
      reqs   -- Dict containing requirements keyed by the related python calls ("sys.platform":"win32")
      perms  -- Dict containing the minimum required security policies (if empty, most restrictive assumed)
      TDL    -- More to be defined in later versions
    """
  </code>
</pre>

<p>There are two tools used to validate a bounty. It comes with an object method to validate itself to the minimum definition, and there is also an external method which the user can change as needed. This allows a user to filter out the ips of known attackers, or permissions that it cannot use.</p>

<p>The object verification method checks four things. First it checks if the ip address is in the valid ipv4 range. Second, it checks if the Bitcoin address is in the proper namespace (but does not check if it has enough funds until later). Next, it checks if the reward is in the valid range. Finally, it checks the timeout value. If all of these are valid, it propagates the bounty to its peers.</p>

<h2>
<a id="tests" class="anchor" href="#tests" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tests</h2>

<p>Tests are a vital part of the network. Like there are ways for clients to exclude invalid requests, there must also be a way for servers to exclude inappropriate clients. They can do this with small bits of test code. The client will then send them the result of this code, and if it is correct, will receive the real problem.</p>

<p>This opens an avenue of attack for the network, however, so there must be constraints on these tests. These will be defined at a later time.<script type="text/javascript">addFootnote("Fork bombing and other such annoyances are a major concern with the test network. Because of this, any solution that necessitates trust must be rejected. Code analysis for any obvious concerns will be necessary, but may not be enough.");</script></p>

<h2>
<a id="queries" class="anchor" href="#queries" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Queries</h2>

<p>After all of this, the query is finally sent to the client. Simultaneously, a <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#micropayment-channel">payment channel</a><script type="text/javascript">addFootnote("This opens up a security risk to the user because their private key is exposed to my program. This is the single biggest reason that this must be an open source project. Encryption will be explored.");</script> is opened. This channel will be updated once per minute as long as there is an active connection between the server and client, and will grow at a linear rate until a result is achieved, but will never reach the full bounty until a result is submitted. This is to protect from fraud on both the server and user end. The server is protected in that the client has an incentive to stay online, and the user is protected in that the connection will expire if a predetermined time goes by without a result.</p>

<p>Upon closing the connection, the reward is distributed between the two parties in the way agreed upon in the last transaction broadcast. If a result is given, the full bounty will be delivered. The transactions are always broadcast with a lock-time of 24 hours.

<h2>
<a id="servers" class="anchor" href="#servers" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Servers</h2>

<p>The server side of this has two additional components: a propagator and a parser. The propagator handles requests from various clients. It is comprised of a wallet,<script type="text/javascript">addFootnote("Part of the common library.");</script> a socket,<script type="text/javascript">addFootnote("Overrides of the standard peer management system.");</script> and (at least) two files. The wallet is used to pay clients in the manner described above. By necessity it spawns large numbers of threads—one per client connected. The socket decides which file to send to clients, and then sends them. When the socket receives a file, it passes it on to the parser.</p>

<p>The parser has two purposes: analyze test results, and move problem results to the proper area. Because of this, test results take the priority. This piece must be written by the server maintainers; there is no general solution for it. When it is not doing this, the parser moves solution files to a different folder, where it can be analyzed without slowing down the rest of the server.</p>
